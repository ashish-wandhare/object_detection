End-to-End AI Development: Building a Smart Shelf Inventory System from Raw Images
Project Overview :
This project provides a comprehensive hands-on experience in building a complete AI system for retail inventory management. You will start with completely unlabeled store shelf images and progress through the entire development lifecycle to create a functional product detection and counting system.
The Real Problem We're Solving :
Imagine you're a store manager facing these daily challenges:
Empty Shelf Problem :
Customers can't find products they want, leading to lost sales that you don't discover until it's too late.
Manual Counting Headache :	
Employees waste hours tediously counting products aisle by aisle - an expensive, inefficient process.
Organization Chaos :
Products get misplaced, price tags don't match, and shelves look unprofessional.
Financial Drain :
You're losing 4-8% of potential sales from out-of-stock items while spending over $15,000 annually per store just on manual counting labor.

Our Cool Solution:
We're going to build a "Store Superpower" - an AI that can:
1) See Everything Instantly: 
Scan entire shelves in seconds, spotting exactly what's in stock, what's running low, and what's missing
2) Count Like a Machine:
Accurately track every product without human error, freeing up your team from tedious manual counting.
3) Alert You Before Problems Happen:
Get real-time warnings about empty shelves and low stock so you can restock before customers notice.
Think of it like:
A Super-Efficient Employee that works 24/7, never gets tired, and never misses a detail
Crystal Ball for Your Inventory showing you exactly what you'll need before you need it
Store Health Monitor that constantly checks your shelves and alerts you the moment something's wrong
Dataset Details:
Total Images: 9000
Classes:
cake, candy, cereal, chips, chocolate, coffee, fish, honey, jam, milk, oil, pasta, rice, soda, sugar, tea, vinegar, water
Annotations: Bounding boxes marking each fruit
Format: YOLOv5/YOLOv8 compatible format.
Expected Learning Outcomes:
Learn the fundamentals of object detection using bounding box annotations.
Understand dataset preprocessing, annotation, and augmentation.
Train state-of-the-art YOLO models (YOLOv8).
Evaluate model performance using mAP and IoU metrics.
Optionally deploy the trained model for real-time detection using OpenCV or Streamlit.
